To my mind, however, the argument is unsustainable. In the first place, it is evident, as the majority of the Court of Appeal pointed out, that the relevant provisions of RIPA, HRA and the CPR all came into force at the same time as part of a single legislative scheme. With effect from 2 October 2000 section 7(1)(a) HRA jurisdiction came into existence (i) in respect of section 65(3) proceedings in the IPT pursuant to section 65(2)(a), and (ii) in respect of any other section 7(1)(a) HRA proceedings in the courts pursuant to section 7(9) and CPR 7.11.

I am satisfied that the FTT’s analysis involves no error of law in this respect. Indeed, the FTT is to be commended for explaining the test under section 14(1) in such a succinct, straightforward and user-friendly way. In particular I agree with the FTT that “the common sense application of the ordinary meaning of the word [vexatious] to the actual circumstances of an individual case must be the correct approach to adopt”. The FTT further concluded that an ordinary dictionary “definition of ‘tending to cause trouble or harassment by unjustified interference’ fairly summarises the meaning”. In Dransfield I suggested that the term “vexatious” connotes the “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure” (Dransfield at paragraph 27, agreeing with the conclusion of the FTT in Lee v Information Commissioner and King’s College Cambridge EA/2012/0015, 0049 and 0085 at [69]).

The former Information Tribunal adopted that approach (see e.g. Guardian Newspapers Ltd v Information Commissioner and the BBC [2007] UKIT EA/2006/0013 at paragraph [14]).

I doubt very much whether any of Mr Ainslie’s six requests were likely to cause distress to any member of the County Council’s staff. I suspect that the amount of disruption involved, given the well-focussed nature of each request, was likely to be minimal. I think it very likely that the requests caused considerable irritation in some quarters at Dorset CC, but that is hardly decisive (see Dransfield at paragraph 26).

It is enough to draw attention to four features of the practice as it then existed. First, telephones had for many years been tapped, and mail intercepted, pursuant to warrants issued by an appropriate secretary of state. Secondly, in cases culminating in criminal prosecution the tap or intercept was used for purposes of preventing and detecting crime, and not for the purpose of prosecuting culprits: the product of the tap or intercept was not relied on as evidence. Thirdly, there was no rule of law or practice which rendered inadmissible in criminal proceedings the product of any unofficial or private eavesdropping activity. While a trial judge might exclude such evidence in the exercise of his overriding discretion to ensure the fairness of a trial, he would not in the absence of special circumstances have been at all likely to do so.

First, there is nothing whatever which suggests an intention to depart from the principle that the issue of warrants by a secretary of state and all matters pertaining to such warrants should not be the subject of enquiry in the course of a criminal trial. Secondly, there was nothing in the 2000 Act, nor in the consultation paper which preceded it (Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom, Cm 4368, 1999), nor in the Hansard references to which the House was referred, which questioned or threw doubt on the decisions in R v Ahmed and R v Effik (see paragraph 8 above) in which the court had examined whether an interception had been made within a public or a private system. Since the 2000 Act was passed, there have been further Court of Appeal decisions in which the same enquiry has been conducted: R v Allan [2001] EWCA Crim 1027 (6 April 2001, unreported); R v Goodman [2002] EWCA Crim 903 (4 March 2002, unreported). Thirdly, there is nothing in the 2000 Act or in any other materials the House has been shown to suggest a parliamentary intention to render inadmissible as evidence in criminal proceedings any material which had previously been admissible, save to the extent explained in paragraph 20 below. As already shown, the United Kingdom practice has been to exclude the product of warranted interception from the public domain and thus to preclude its use as evidence. But this has been a policy choice, not a requirement compelled by the Convention, and other countries have made a different policy choice. Article 8(2) of the European Convention permits necessary and proportionate interference with the right guaranteed in article 8(1) if in accordance with the law and if in the interests of national security, public safety, the economic well-being of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Save where necessary to preserve the security of warranted interception, there is no reason why it should have been sought to exclude the product of any lawful interception where relevant as evidence in any case whether civil or criminal.",

One of the considerations which may move a Minister to grant a certificate like the present is that publication would or might be injurious to that freedom and candour of communication in writing between the officers of a department, which are of great importance to public administration: and the responsible Minister or the head of the public department must be the judge whether the disclosure of documents would have an adverse effect by inducing among public servants a cautious timidity in expressing their views. The judgments of Lord President Dunedin, Lord M'Laren, Lord Kinnear and Lord Pearson in The Admiralty v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling and Fishing Co. are conclusive on this point, but these judgments do not deal explicitly with the question whether the Courts in Scotland have the power to override the ministerial certificate.

We apply that approach to what the Tribunal has done here. Paragraph 160 self-evidently comes at the end of a very full and lengthy set of Reasons. The written Reasons are extremely well-structured, ample and well- written. The passage at paragraph 160 must be seen in the context of the Tribunal’s earlier findings of fact and, in particular, in the context of the adverse finding of age discrimination. The Tribunal, in our judgment, have sufficiently explained why the dismissal of this particular Claimant was found unfair. It has explained why the process was unfair and it has set out sufficient as to the background context for one to understand why it was able to conclude, as it did, that the exercise here was designed solely to produce the result that it was Ms Simpson who would be the one person made redundant from amongst those who faced potential redundancy.",
