To my mind, however, the argument is unsustainable. In the first place, it is evident, as the majority of the Court of Appeal pointed out, that the relevant provisions of RIPA, HRA and the CPR all came into force at the same time as part of a single legislative scheme. With effect from 2 October 2000 section 7(1)(a) HRA jurisdiction came into existence (i) in respect of section 65(3) proceedings in the IPT pursuant to section 65(2)(a), and (ii) in respect of any other section 7(1)(a) HRA proceedings in the courts pursuant to section 7(9) and CPR 7.11.

I am satisfied that the FTT’s analysis involves no error of law in this respect. Indeed, the FTT is to be commended for explaining the test under section 14(1) in such a succinct, straightforward and user-friendly way. In particular I agree with the FTT that “the common sense application of the ordinary meaning of the word [vexatious] to the actual circumstances of an individual case must be the correct approach to adopt”. The FTT further concluded that an ordinary dictionary “definition of ‘tending to cause trouble or harassment by unjustified interference’ fairly summarises the meaning”. In Dransfield I suggested that the term “vexatious” connotes the “manifestly unjustified, inappropriate or improper use of a formal procedure” (Dransfield at paragraph 27, agreeing with the conclusion of the FTT in Lee v Information Commissioner and King’s College Cambridge EA/2012/0015, 0049 and 0085 at [69]).

The former Information Tribunal adopted that approach (see e.g. Guardian Newspapers Ltd v Information Commissioner and the BBC [2007] UKIT EA/2006/0013 at paragraph [14]).

I doubt very much whether any of Mr Ainslie’s six requests were likely to cause distress to any member of the County Council’s staff. I suspect that the amount of disruption involved, given the well-focussed nature of each request, was likely to be minimal. I think it very likely that the requests caused considerable irritation in some quarters at Dorset CC, but that is hardly decisive (see Dransfield at paragraph 26).

It is enough to draw attention to four features of the practice as it then existed. First, telephones had for many years been tapped, and mail intercepted, pursuant to warrants issued by an appropriate secretary of state. Secondly, in cases culminating in criminal prosecution the tap or intercept was used for purposes of preventing and detecting crime, and not for the purpose of prosecuting culprits: the product of the tap or intercept was not relied on as evidence.

First, there is nothing whatever which suggests an intention to depart from the principle that the issue of warrants by a secretary of state and all matters pertaining to such warrants should not be the subject of enquiry in the course of a criminal trial. Secondly, there was nothing in the 2000 Act, nor in the consultation paper which preceded it (Interception of Communications in the United Kingdom, Cm 4368, 1999), nor in the Hansard references to which the House was referred, which questioned or threw doubt on the decisions in R v Ahmed and R v Effik (see paragraph 8 above) in which the court had examined whether an interception had been made within a public or a private system. Since the 2000 Act was passed, there have been further Court of Appeal decisions in which the same enquiry has been conducted: R v Allan [2001] EWCA Crim 1027 (6 April 2001, unreported); R v Goodman [2002] EWCA Crim 903 (4 March 2002, unreported). Thirdly, there is nothing in the 2000 Act or in any other materials the House has been shown to suggest a parliamentary intention to render inadmissible as evidence in criminal proceedings any material which had previously been admissible, save to the extent explained in paragraph 20 below. As already shown, the United Kingdom practice has been to exclude the product of warranted interception from the public domain and thus to preclude its use as evidence. But this has been a policy choice, not a requirement compelled by the Convention, and other countries have made a different policy choice. Article 8(2) of the European Convention permits necessary and proportionate interference with the right guaranteed in article 8(1) if in accordance with the law and if in the interests of national security, public safety, the economic well-being of the country, the prevention of disorder or crime, the protection of health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. Save where necessary to preserve the security of warranted interception, there is no reason why it should have been sought to exclude the product of any lawful interception where relevant as evidence in any case whether civil or criminal.",

One of the considerations which may move a Minister to grant a certificate like the present is that publication would or might be injurious to that freedom and candour of communication in writing between the officers of a department, which are of great importance to public administration: and the responsible Minister or the head of the public department must be the judge whether the disclosure of documents would have an adverse effect by inducing among public servants a cautious timidity in expressing their views. The judgments of Lord President Dunedin, Lord M'Laren, Lord Kinnear and Lord Pearson in The Admiralty v. Aberdeen Steam Trawling and Fishing Co. are conclusive on this point, but these judgments do not deal explicitly with the question whether the Courts in Scotland have the power to override the ministerial certificate.

We apply that approach to what the Tribunal has done here. Paragraph 160 self-evidently comes at the end of a very full and lengthy set of Reasons. The written Reasons are extremely well-structured, ample and well- written. The passage at paragraph 160 must be seen in the context of the Tribunal’s earlier findings of fact and, in particular, in the context of the adverse finding of age discrimination. The Tribunal, in our judgment, have sufficiently explained why the dismissal of this particular Claimant was found unfair. It has explained why the process was unfair and it has set out sufficient as to the background context for one to understand why it was able to conclude, as it did, that the exercise here was designed solely to produce the result that it was Ms Simpson who would be the one person made redundant from amongst those who faced potential redundancy.",

For the reasons given by the Master of the Rolls, the decisions in Sion, Walters and Ronayne are not authoritative on the present issue. The difficulty, however, is Taylor v A. Novo. I have not found it easy to identify the precise ratio of that decision. There are some parts of the reasoning in paras. 29 and 30 of Lord Dyson's judgment that suggest that he saw the crucial feature of the case as being that there had been an initial \"accident\" which could in principle have constituted a shocking event, if witnessed, and that that meant that any subsequent such event could not be regarded as sufficiently proximate: that was Chamberlain J's analysis. But I have come to the conclusion that if the judgment is read as a whole the ratio is wider than that. At para. 33 Lord Dyson said that \"it follows from what I have said above\" that the reasoning of Auld J in Taylor v Somerset Health Authority was correct, and he rejected Peter Gibson LJ's contrary observations in Sion on the basis that they were obiter dicta. The essence of the reasoning which he was thereby endorsing was that there could be no liability for psychiatric injury to the claimant caused by witnessing her husband's death \"long after the negligence which had caused it\", as opposed to injury caused by a traumatic event occurring at the time of the breach of duty (see the passage quoted at para. 11). Against that background, the fair reading of paras. 29 and 30 seems to be that the ultimately decisive feature was simply that there had been an interval of time between the breach of duty, whether or not it occasioned any injury at the time, and the shocking event. In Taylor v A. Novo itself the interval was three weeks, but the principle must be the same whatever the interval, provided it is not part of the same sequence of events as in cases of the Walters kind.",

What was in issue was the cost of excavation and lining the excavation with concrete. The key findings of fact were these. The dock could not be used to repair ships without the valves and pumps.

The valves, the machinery for the provision of electricity and the pumps were an integral part of the dock as a functioning entity.

The purpose of the pool was to provide and retain a suitable body of water which was circulated, cleansed and heated, and so would provide a medium which the visitors to the caravan park could enjoy. The water that the pool was designed to contain could not be divorced from the structure of the pool and its apparatus. It was, therefore, treated as an integral whole.

On the one hand, one would wish to avoid a test which sets up a trial on the merits, even if only a provisional one. On the other hand, where there is established Regulation or Convention jurisdiction subject to a jurisdiction clause, the choice is not merely between two competing jurisdiction clauses, but between the established jurisdiction and a jurisdiction clause derogating from that jurisdiction. Since an English jurisdiction clause does not here derogate from the established jurisdiction, the real competition in this case is between England as the established jurisdiction and the Zambian clause relied on by the Reinsurers. Moreover, there may be a difference between a jurisdiction established by mandatory international rules as under the Regulation and a jurisdiction merely accepted by the English courts as part of their national rules, including their long-arm statute, and always subject to their overriding and inherent discretion. Where the choice arises under the Regulation itself and article 23 is in question – which Colman J has held is not the case here in respect of the Zambian clause since that is not a clause giving jurisdiction to a court or the courts of a Member Stat  (article 23.1) – article 23 itself lays down the conditions for the clause in question, eg that it should be in or evidenced in writin  (article 23.1(a)); and ECJ jurisprudence has held that it is necessary for the applicability of the jurisdiction clause to be without doubt, in the sense that it should be established that the parties' consent has been clearly and precisely demonstrated: see Etsasis Salotti di Colzano Aimo e Gianmario Colzani v.

As is clear from that case, a purchaser of a legal estate in land is not bound by any personal obligation of the vendor even though it may fairly be said that the personal obligation relates to the land in question. By parity of reasoning, in the present case the right to claim a set-off against rent, while it can be said to relate to the lease in the sense that it is being invoked to impeach the tenant's liability to pay rent, is in reality a \"mere\" claim for money, not a right which can be said to be in anyway proprietary. Additionally, although not essential for present purposes, it is a claim which arises from a mere contractual right against the original landlord under an obligation which cannot, after the transfer of the reversion, be invoked against the successor of that landlord.",

In that case the amended allegation against the practitioner was to the effect that he had knowingly given a false and misleading response to an inquiry by his local health authority in relation to a complaint by a patient. The evidence against the practitioner was all agreed and the committee's decision depended on the inferences drawn from that evidence and from the oral evidence given by the practitioner. After considering the evidence, the committee decided that particular heads of the charge had been proved. The committee gave no reasons for its decision. The practitioner appealed to this Board on the basis that the committee should have given its reasons for finding against the practitioner on the charge that he had known that his response to the health authority had been false and misleading. Giving the decision of the Board, Lord Hope of Craighead first drew attention to the nature and composition of the committee, comprising medical practitioners and lay members, acting with the legal advice of their assessor. The rules required the committee, as a committee, to reach a view on the matters for its determination and there was no provision for expressions of dissent. In these circumstances, said Lord Hope at p 7- Whilst I fully accept that the instant case is not a proper forum for the promulgation of guidelines, my provisional view is that paragraph 14 of the decision of the Privy Council in Gupta v GMC identifies an approach which reflects current norms of judicial behaviour. In every case, as it seems to me, every Tribunal (including the PCC of the GMC) needs to ask itself the elementary questions: is what we have decided clear? Have we explained our decision and how we have reached it in such a way that the parties before us can understand clearly why they have won or why they have lost?",

First, it was not necessary for Miss Rose to develop any submissions on the points which my Lord makes in the paras. cited, and therefore we have not heard what she would have submitted, no doubt very helpfully, on this point. We do not know what the practical implications are: No-one would want to cause unnecessary delays in the delivery of decisions by the GMC. That would not be in the public interest. By contrast with this court, the Privy Council had enormous experience in dealing with these appeals and we should not lightly cast aside the benefit of that heritage. Indeed I would say that in this particular field the judge was right to treat the decision in Gupta as binding on him unless it could not stand with a decision of this court or of the House of Lords. If the relevant decision of the Privy Council was inconsistent with a decision of the House of Lords, this court would in turn have to take account of the what was recently decided by the Criminal Division of this court in R v James, R v Karimi [2006] 1All ER 759. Secondly, the decision in English v Emery Reimbold does not encourage appeals on the grounds of adequacy of reasons: see for example paras. 30 and 53 to 57 of the judgment of the court. In my judgment the English case establishes that a decision of a court does not infringe article 6 or the common law on the grounds that the reasons are not spelt out if the reasons can be deduced from other sources to which reference may properly be made: see the judgment in the English case at the paras already cited and para. 26. Applying that to this case, to the extent that the issue was for example whether Mr Phipps' explanations for his misstatements were accepted, it seems to me that Mr Phipps can have little doubt that the reason why he lost is that the GMC found his explanations incredible in the light of the evidence and general matters of practice of which both would be aware.",

The first is the fact that the section creates a criminal offence (CA 1989, section 97(6)) and therefore needs to be construed strictly. The second is that the use of the phrase \"as being involved in any proceedings\" in CA 1989, section 97(2)(a) connotes the identification of a period when those proceedings are pending and not concluded. The third is that the thrust of the authorities - to which I will refer later in this judgment - is that there is no special privilege accorded to children who are the subject matter of proceeding save as is strictly necessary for their protection in the context of the proceedings themselves: see R v Central Independent Television PLC [1994] Fam 192 at 207 per Waite LJ",

A week after the Employment Appeal Tribunal determined the case with which we are concerned, this court addressed that matter in the case of Igen v Wong [2005] EWCA Civ 142. The Employment Appeal Tribunal in Barton had set out a number of guidelines for the attention of Employment Tribunals and others who had to apply section 63A. In Igen v Wong those guidelines were repeated and largely approved, with one or two small additions; this court however at the same time emphasising two elementary points, the first being that guidelines are indeed only guidelines, and the second being that what courts must apply is, at the end of the day, the words of the statute and not glosses upon or attempts to explain those words by other tribunals. It will be necessary in dealing with the arguments advanced in this case, for me to say something about the Barton and Igen guidelines, because a complaint is made that the Employment Tribunal in our case failed to follow them to the extent that its determination was, as I have said, irrevocably damaged. I wish however to emphasise that we have not heard a focused argument, I fear I have to say, about the status of the Igen v Wong guidelines; nor have we heard, or is it necessary to hear, adversary argument about them. I am aware it is likely that that question may return to this court in a more formal way in the coming months, and nothing that I say about the content of the guidelines should be regarded as in any way authoritative, if only for this reason: that I go into them for the purpose of explanation only, because as will rapidly become clear, and was clear to both tribunals below, this case does not even meet the preliminary requirement for the application of section 63A.",

A lessor had claimed to forfeit a lease in breach of covenant to keep in repair. He had issued proceedings and served them upon the lessee who had sub-let the premises to the defendant with a similar covenant to keep the premises in repair. After the proceedings had been served upon the lessor, he assigned the lease to the plaintiff who having obtained relief from forfeiture under s.14(2) of the Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1881 on terms that he should hold the premises according to the old lease without any new lease brought an action against the defendant for rent due upon the underlease subsequent to the issue and service of the writ to recover possession. The defendant argued that the issue of the writ for possession by the lessor was an irrevocable election by him to treat the lease as void and made the lease void thus putting an end to the underlease. Cozens-Hardy M.R. rejected this argument. He held that the order relieving the plaintiff from forfeiture of the lease and ordering that she held the demised premises according to the lease without any new lease meant that the right of re-entry for forfeiture was got rid of. He said at page 269:",

In O'Rourke v Camden LBC [1990] 3 WLR 86 at p.90, Lord Hoffmann said: \".... the Act is a scheme of social welfare, intended to confer benefits at the public expense on grounds of public policy. Public money is spent on housing the homeless not merely for the private benefit of people who find themselves homeless but on grounds of general public interest; because, for example, proper housing means that people will be less likely to suffer illness, turn to crime or require the attention of other social services.\" In Ex parte Puhlhofer [1986] AC 484 at p.517, Lord Brightman said:",

In his first category fell cases in which the defendant's negligence consisted of some positive act or misfeasance and the question of causation was one of historical fact, in which event proof on the balance of probability prevailed. In the second category fell cases in which the defendant's negligence consisted of an omission where causation depended not upon a question of historical fact but upon the answer to the hypothetical question 'what would the plaintiff have done if there had been no negligence?'; here the answer is provided by the application of proof on the balance of probabilities. In the third category fell cases in which the plaintiff's loss depended upon the hypothetical action of a third party, whether in addition to action by the plaintiff or independently of it; here the plaintiff need only show that he had a substantial chance of the third party acting in such a way as to benefit him. The Court of Appeal held that the plaintiffs needed to show only that there was a significant chance, which could be less than likely, that the third party would have been prepared to offer them this protection and held that the loss of such a chance had been made out and it was assessed at 50%. This Court adopted a similar approach to the valuation of a chance in Stovold v Barlows (The Times, 30 October 1995), Stuart-Smith LJ presiding). The Court evaluated the chance as 50% on the ground that a successful sale depended on two contingencies, first that, if the deeds had been posted as instructed, they would in fact have arrived by the stipulated date, and secondly, that even if they had arrived by then, the prospective purchaser would not have decided to buy another house. A similar test in a personal injury award was adopted by Mr Roger Bell QC (now Bell J) in Anderson v Davis [1993] PIQR Q87, when he held that the plaintiff, had it not been for his injuries, would have had a two-thirds chance of obtaining promotion as a principal lecturer.

Moreover, the assessment of damages is subjective in the sense that the loss is loss sustained by the actual plaintiff, not some hypothetical plaintiff (see per Phillimore J. in Thomas McGhie & Sons Ltd v British Transport Commission [1962] 2 All ER 646.656G).This case lasted for 30 days and many complex issues arose, many of which have not concerned this Court. Counsel have to direct the evidence, cross-examination and their submissions to the live issues in the case. They should not waste time tilting at windmills. It is important, if the judge has it in mind to adopt an approach to some important issue which has not been canvassed at trial that he should give the parties a proper opportunity to deal with it. In Hoecheong Products Ltd v Cargill Ltd [1995] 1 WLR 404 at 409A-C, Lord Mustill said: Mr Field submitted that this Court should not interfere with the judge's assessment. He had the feel of the case and was in a better position after a long hearing to judge the effect of the overstated profit than this Court. We cannot accept this submission. A similar submission was made to the Court of Appeal in Jade Tower Ltd v NM Schroder Financial Management Ltd (unreported transcript 6 April 1995).
